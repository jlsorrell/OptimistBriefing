# Whole-plan Fix Round 1 Report

## Outcome

Whole-plan review findings were repaired with strict TDD. Human-readable Papers With Code, GDELT, and Federal Register text is decoded before routing and signal derivation. Structural section metadata remains raw and must validate as an edition section. Provider-text input and output bounds no longer split surrogate pairs, and the primitive coverage now explicitly protects the input cap, two-pass cap, C1 rejection, and named-apostrophe behavior.

## RED evidence

Primitive boundary and coverage command:

```sh
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/provider-text.test.ts -t "C1|named apos|100,000|third decode|surrogate pair"
```

Result: exit 1; the surrogate-safe truncation test failed with `A�` instead of `A`. The four explicit allowlist/bound coverage tests passed.

Structural section command:

```sh
npx vitest run tests/unit/editorial/normalize.test.ts -t "structural section metadata"
```

Result: exit 1; encoded `&#114;esearch` metadata incorrectly produced `primaryTopic: "research"`.

Papers With Code command:

```sh
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/publication-collector.test.ts -t "topical provider text"
```

Result: exit 1; the collected title retained `&#105;` and did not provide decoded topical text to publication routing.

API-news command:

```sh
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/news-collector.test.ts -t "GDELT provider text|Federal Register text"
```

Result: exit 1; both regressions failed because titles/evidence retained entity references before signal derivation.

Input-cap surrogate command, added during self-review:

```sh
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/provider-text.test.ts -t "input inspection bound"
```

Result: exit 1; the 100,000-character input cap retained a lone high surrogate.

## GREEN evidence

Targeted commands:

```sh
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/provider-text.test.ts -t "C1|named apos|100,000|third decode|surrogate pair"
npx vitest run tests/unit/editorial/normalize.test.ts -t "structural section metadata"
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/publication-collector.test.ts -t "topical provider text"
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/news-collector.test.ts -t "GDELT provider text|Federal Register text"
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/provider-text.test.ts -t "input inspection bound"
```

Results: all exited 0; respectively 5, 1, 1, 2, and 1 targeted tests passed.

Affected focused suites:

```sh
npx vitest run tests/unit/sources/provider-text.test.ts tests/unit/editorial/normalize.test.ts tests/unit/editorial/route-publication.test.ts tests/unit/sources/publication-collector.test.ts tests/unit/sources/research-collector.test.ts tests/unit/sources/news-collector.test.ts tests/unit/sources/news-signals.test.ts tests/unit/editorial/pipeline.test.ts
```

Result: exit 0; 8 test files passed, 206 tests passed.

Typecheck:

```sh
npm run check
```

Result: exit 0; `tsc --noEmit` passed.

Diff validation:

```sh
git diff --check
```

Result: exit 0; no whitespace errors.

## Commits

- `5872c66149e52863637a7363e87e439c3fe5e161` — `fix: normalize provider text before routing`
- Report commit: recorded in the task handoff because its SHA is created after this file is written.

## Self-review

- Papers With Code normalizes only link display text; paper URLs, identifiers, and dates retain their prior raw handling.
- GDELT normalizes only the provider title before persistence and `deriveNewsSignals`; article URL, seen date, domain, language, country, and external IDs remain raw.
- Federal Register normalizes only title and abstract before persistence and signal derivation; document number, URL, publication date, type, and external IDs remain raw.
- Structural `primarySection`/`section` values use raw whitespace normalization and must pass `EditionSectionSchema`; invalid entity-like values remain in metadata but do not create derived topics or tags.
- Both the 100,000-character inspection cap and configurable output cap iterate code-point boundaries without exceeding their UTF-16 length limits or retaining half a surrogate pair.
- Prior URL/ID boundaries, evidence precedence, topic decoding, extracted-article truncation/access classification, schemas, and evidence bounds remain covered by the affected suites.
- No trusted-HTML insertion, general sanitizer, deployment, canary, migration, or historical rewrite was added.

## Concerns

- None.
